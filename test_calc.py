from calc import add


# Write your tests below.
# Use assert statements to check that calc returns the correct result.
# All test functions must start with test_ to be discovered by pytest or similar frameworks.
# We have included a single starter test.
# Add more test_* functions as you work through each new requirement.
# Example:

def test_example_string_returns_zero():
    assert add("") == 0  # uncomment to test
    pass
